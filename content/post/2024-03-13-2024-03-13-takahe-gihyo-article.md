It was already a half year ago, but I had an opportunity to write two long articles about Takahē in Japanese on the website gihyo.jp, managed by Gijutsu-Hyoron Co., Ltd. (技術評論社), one of the famous technical book publishers in Japan:

2. [情報発信に便利で軽量なActivityPubサーバー「Takahē」［後編］ ～基本的なアーキテクチャと特徴的なコンポーネントの紹介と、サーバーの構築方法 | gihyo.jp](https://gihyo.jp/article/2023/09/takahe-02) (en: [Google Translation](https://gihyo-jp.translate.goog/article/2023/09/takahe-02?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp))

where I introduced Takahē's features and the overview of ActivityPub/Fediverse, I also presented its interesting components and libraries as well as the server usage with Mastodon Client Elk.

It took much time than expected as I came up with many topics while writing and the article length got much longer than the initial plan. 😅

But it was a wonderful experience as I was able to introduce little-known Takahē and its interesting architecture at that time to the Japanese
tech community and learn/explore more about ActivityPub/Fediverse, Django, and many other communities in depth at the same time.
