But I haven&rsquo;t almost no records on my attitude on COVID-19. I&rsquo;d like to record at least current status, especially how I&rsquo;m checking the status and brief summary of the current status in Japan.</p><h2 id=available-monitoring-is-very-limited>Available monitoring is very limited</h2><p>Like US, Japanese government and most municipalities let themselves blind to the COVID-19 monitoring. Previously, most cases are reported from hospitals and data is published daily basis (unfortunately many data was non-machine readable format like PDF). That&rsquo;s not available anymore and only officially published data is limited sample hospital cases now like how the pre-COVID flu survey.</p><p>The recent re-surge is definitely not unexpected. I&rsquo;ve never thought this is reasonable scientific decision same as many doctors and researchers. Objectively, the risk of COVID-19 is much higher than flu. There is some progress of research on the mechanism of long-COVID, but many parts are still unknown and there is no treatment for long-COVID available yet.</p><p><img src=/post/2023-09-17-moderna-dashboard.png alt="moderna dashboard chart as of 2023-09-17">
(<a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/_16823360497460/sheet10?:language=ja-JP&:embed=y&:embed_code_version=3&:loadOrderID=6&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link">chart public source</a> via <a href=https://moderna-epi-report.jp/>Êñ∞Âûã„Ç≥„É≠„Éä„ÉªÂ≠£ÁØÄÊÄß„Ç§„É≥„Éï„É´„Ç®„É≥„Ç∂„ÉªRS„Ç¶„Ç§„É´„Çπ „É™„Ç¢„É´„Çø„Ç§„É†ÊµÅË°å„ÉªÁñ´Â≠¶ÊÉÖÂ†±</a>)</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;m relying on the Moderna&rsquo;s case number estimation, which is only a few reliable data source now but based on data gathered by a private company from many hospitals. The original data is not publicly available nor how they are estimating. This kind of search could and should be done by a public funded project, then all data could be freely available for public and researchers. But I don&rsquo;t know how many people know this dashboard, and it is widely used in Japan.</p><p>Variant surveillance has also been scaled down. <a href=https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/diseases/ka/corona-virus/covid-19.html>National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID)</a> cannot provide the latest frequent results and another option is more timely results published by <a href=https://www.hokeniryo.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/kansen/corona_portal/henikabu/screening.html>Bureau of Public Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Government</a>.</p><p>By the way, sadly, NIID website still doesn&rsquo;t support responsive style, so it&rsquo;s hard or stressful to check the latest update on mobile phone. The other website always put data as image with an empty alt or machine-unreadable PDF format. No accessibility consideration on the year when new not so strict Disability Discrimination Elimination Act are come into effect late.</p><p>There were the clear information logistics issues across many organizations since the pandemic started though. Many hospital uses FAX to send cases and diagnosis data to regional health authority. Honestly, that&rsquo;s ridiculous. These few years were a very good opportunity to solve many problem with the software technology.</p><p>It&rsquo;s disappointing to abandon the most monitoring without solving the clear issues using a good engineering. That&rsquo;s not impossible at all if any proper decision-making. There are good internet infrastructures here, good software engineers, people would want to provide the help, but I can see not many required coordination are done.</p><h2 id=new-covid-19-yearly-booster-will-be-available-timely>New COVID-19 (yearly?) booster will be available timely</h2><p>This is a good news. I was not allowed to get a new booster since the last October so I was concerned that my immune have been weaned down not enough to prevent long-COVID in case I got COVID-19 again.</p><p>Until the last booster, most COVID-19 vaccines are available in Japan a month or so after new shots are available in US. I don&rsquo;t complain that since there are many countries around the world not necessarily better than Japan.</p><p>However, unexpectedly, it seems that we can get the new XBB 1.5 updated vaccines are available timely almost same as US. <a href=https://www.city.matsudo.chiba.jp/iryoutoshi/corona_vaccine/detail/r5kaisituikasessyu.html>The city website</a> wrote that the vaccine is not approved yet but will provide a new shot since 2023-09-20 and now FDA approved. I guess this might be because a low vaccination rate in US, and they prioritize other nations similarly, but I don&rsquo;t know the actual process. As far as I know, information on how these vaccine supply is negotiated between Japanese government and US pharmaceutical companies are not publicly available. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with this anti-openness.</p><h2 id=people-stop-wearing-mask>People stop wearing mask</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t understand how people is thinking on the situation. SARS-CoV-2 is just a biological machine and just follows the rule of physics using their body&rsquo;s biological mechanism. This fact will never be changed until, for example, we gave up our biological body&mldr;?</p><p>They never react to political decision or people&rsquo;s optimistic/blinded thought. In Japan, ~90% people were wearing mask in public space until the government (kind of) declared &ldquo;COVID-19 is over&rdquo; several months ago (though not over at all). Maybe many people just react the atmosphere to other people and haven&rsquo;t based on the science or factual data.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much risk of long-COVID is acknowledged properly in Japan. Also, Japan never adopted the term &ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo; and still uses &ldquo;new coronavirus infection&rdquo; against world standard and never use &ldquo;long-COVID&rdquo;&mldr; That&rsquo;s a bad thing for everyone since this kind of not-using correct terminology will decrease accessibility to correct latest information.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have plan to change how to behave to protect myself from infection potentially disable me to work for several months. I got COVID-19 from family member around the first time arising of the first Omicron variant, and it made me unable to get up over several hours for about a month even after two doses. Also, I&rsquo;d like to avoid indirect possibly deadly infections for vulnerable others as possible.</p><h2 id=information-sources>Information sources</h2><p>I&rsquo;m learning the latest updates about COVID-19 mainly from these resources:</p><ul><li>NPR&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave>Short Wave</a> and many other programs.</li><li>Latest news and interviews from many scientists working on the latest research on <a href=https://www.sciencefriday.com/>Science Friday</a>.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Topol>Eric Topol</a>&rsquo;s post about latest COVID-19 research papers.</li></ul><h2>Comments</h2><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=shuuji3/weblog issue-term=pathname label=utterances theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></section></div><div class=container><div class=pagination><a class="btn btn-primary text-white pull-right" href=https://weblog.shuuji3.xyz/post/2023-09-16-taiwanese-character-encoding/><i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden=true></i> Previous</a>
